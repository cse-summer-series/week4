// A main program that takes input from the user
// and prints out the string up to the first space character:
// $ ./before_first_space
// Joe Politz
// Joe
// One Two Three
// One
// José
// José

// This uses utf8_substring!
// 1. Make sure there are no memory leaks
//      - run top, press o, type COMMAND=before_first_space
//      - use valgrind!
//    May need to update spew to have something with a space in it!
// 2. Write the _ref version of utf8_substring that takes a to_write
//    array as an argument. Make sure that also has no leaks!
